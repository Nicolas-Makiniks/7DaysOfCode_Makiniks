# 7DaysOfCode_Makiniks
Participating in the #7DaysOfCode challenge, and here is where I going to share my results

## 📝 Daily Report - Day 1

🗓 Date: 24/06/2025

⏳ Time spend: ~1h

📁 Project/task:

> Studied and practiced JavaScript comparison operators (```==``` vs ```===```).

💡 Concepts Learned:

1. Loose equality ```==```: Java Script automatically converts types to compare only values.

2. Strict equality ```===```: Compares both value and type.

3. Using template literals in ```console.log```: I learned to interpolate variables directly in strings using backticks and ```${variableHere}```
> I found this much simpler than what I was used to in C or C++

```
let numberOne = 1;
let stringOne = '1';

if (numberOne == stringOne) {
  console.log(`The variables numberOne: ${numberOne} and stringOne: '${stringOne}' have the same value but different types`);
}
```
